# Digital-doilies

This repository contains the source code of a Java application that is similar to Paint, but lets you divide the screen into multiple sectors and draw simetrically in each one to create doilies. Brush color and size can be changed, strokes can be undone and doilies can be saved as .png files locally, etc.

To run the program:

1) cd src/
2) javac Main.java
3) java Main

Below is an example doily that was created by drawing in the application.
